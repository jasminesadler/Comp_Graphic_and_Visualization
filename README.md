How do I approach designing software?
I made a plan before hand of which shapes I wanted to include and what they needed to look like. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I have never used OpenGL before so everything that I created was new to me. It was really interesting to learn about all of it. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
For me being as organized as possible it key. So keeping that going through future projects will be very useful. 

How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs can be very overwhelming. For me breaking everything down into part is key. For this project once I got the base of the porject created it was easy to add the other parts. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Learning how to add the different parts together chnaged. At first I was removing a lot and readding it. I soon relized I only needed to add to certain parts. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is to work in cybersecurity. ALthough this isn't directly affecting cybersecurity, I do think it's important to make sure I have all the other knowledge under my belt to. 
This is not only going to give me more information to possible explore different career changes in the future, but it will also help me understand cybersecurity better also.
